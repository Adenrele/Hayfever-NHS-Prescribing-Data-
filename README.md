# Hayfever-NHS-Prescribing-Data-
As a pharmacist and MSc data science student, my interests lie in the intersection of healthcare and data. As such, I have found myself exploring NHS prescribing
data with a focus on oral antihistamines.

The long term goal of this personal project is the production of a model using NHS prescribing data as well as pollen count data. Use cases for such models include:

Assesing compliance with NHSE OTC guidance.

Predicting community pharmacy OTC (over the counter) workload.

Advising hayfever sufferers like myself on the best time to take preventative measures.

Advising those that suffer from hayfever on when to begin to stock up on products.


I have been met with many challenges when attempting to extract this data within the limitations of a 2017 Macbook Air. Therefore, my first upload is relates to
extraction of prescribing data using through the CKAN API using requests and the use of Pandas to create a memory efficient dataframe.
