# Hayfever-NHS-Prescribing-Data-
As a pharmacist and MSc data science student, my interests lie in the intersection of healthcare and data. As such, I have found myself exploring NHS prescribing
data with a focus on oral antihistamines.

The long term goal of this personal project is the production of a model using NHS prescribing data as well as pollen count data. Use cases for such models include:

Assesing compliance with NHSE OTC guidance.

Predicting community pharmacy OTC (over the counter) workload.

Advising hayfever sufferers like myself on the best time to take preventative measures.

Advising those that suffer from hayfever on when to begin to stock up on products.



<b>Part One </b>
- Interrogate the CKAN API using Requests and read the datasets using Pandas.
- Discuss memory, storage and time inefficiencies of this method.

Part Two
- Use SQL for more efficiency than was seen in part one.
- Combine with ONS area classification data with NHS prescribing data.
- Perpare Met Office pollen count data.
- Create a simple distributed program using AWS EC2 and XML-RPC.
- Simple exploratory data analysis.
